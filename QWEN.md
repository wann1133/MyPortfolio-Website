Create a portfolio website for me.
I want the website to have a summary page about myself, my skills, a showcase of my projects, and a link to my GitHub repo. A page that displays my licenses and certifications, which, when clicked, will pop up a picture of my certification. A contact page to reach me. Also, create some social media buttons. Add animations to make it more engaging.

 the theme of the website to black but still modern and contemporary? Also create a footer for the website and place social media buttons in the footer. And I want a running animation on my landing page.

Well, finally, I want a more modern navbar. Make a transparent or glass-like navbar to make it look more attractive.

I want each page to have its own separate page.

create with react.js + vite

I'll revise it. On the home page, display the about and skills pages. Don't separate them. Make the display neat. I also want the project page to have an href link to my GitHub repo project. Also, please replace the social media buttons with the original social media logos.
